# Web-Audio-Context

This pure javascript outlines the very basics of what can be done with the Web audio api, and a (very litt) bit of knowledge of music theory.

The main part of this project is reece.js - It is a very simple synthesiser which can be played straight from your Browser's console - just copy and paste.

# Todo

This project serves mainly as an example of what can be done natively - no HTML or build required to add music to a website. 

1. Web audio api allows for wave manipulation over time - so Attack, Decay, Sustain and release is to be added.
2. I have  a seperate project with a sterio imager, which may expand into [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
3. I will be working on some interesting audio visual effects for presenting waves. Beyond that I am far more interested in how far we can push the [MDN Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
